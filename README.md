# Clustering Unlabeled Sound Data
## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the process of clustering unlabeled sound data using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to group similar sound files together based on their features, which can be useful for tasks like sound classification, anomaly detection, or organizing large datasets of audio files.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The notebook begins by loading the sound data from a zip file.
   - Audio files are processed to extract features using the `librosa` library, specifically Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are commonly used in audio analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - MFCCs are extracted from each audio file and averaged to create a feature vector for each file.
   - The feature vectors are then normalized and stored in a NumPy array for further processing.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors.
   - These techniques help in visualizing the data and improving the performance of clustering algorithms by reducing noise and computational complexity.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Two clustering algorithms are applied to the reduced feature space:
     - **K-Means**: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions the data into a predefined number of clusters.
     - **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking points that are far away as outliers.
   - The performance of each clustering method is evaluated using metrics like the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

5. **Visualization**:
   - The results of the clustering are visualized using scatter plots, where each point represents an audio file, and colors represent different clusters.
   - This helps in understanding the structure of the data and the effectiveness of the clustering algorithms.

6. **Analysis**:
   - The notebook concludes with an analysis of why certain clustering methods performed better and how dimensionality reduction impacted the clustering results.
   - The findings are related to real-world clustering challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, noise, and unknown cluster structures.

## Key Findings

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA and t-SNE helped in reducing the complexity of the data, making it easier to visualize and cluster. They also improved the performance of clustering algorithms by focusing on the most important features.
  
- **Clustering Methods**: 
  - **K-Means** worked well when the data formed spherical clusters, but it required specifying the number of clusters in advance.
  - **DBSCAN** was effective in identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes, and it was robust to noise and outliers.

- **Real-World Challenges**: The notebook highlights the importance of choosing the right clustering method and dimensionality reduction technique based on the nature of the data. It also emphasizes the challenges of handling high-dimensional data, noise, and unknown cluster structures in real-world applications.

2. **Load the Data**:
   - Place your sound data in a zip file and update the path in the notebook to point to your data.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, extract features, reduce dimensionality, perform clustering, and visualize the results.

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - Review the clustering results and visualizations to understand the structure of your data and the effectiveness of the clustering methods.
